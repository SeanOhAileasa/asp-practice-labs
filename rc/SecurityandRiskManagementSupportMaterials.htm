<p id="cn-m2-42">Security management encompasses the administrative, 
technical and physical controls necessary to adequately protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability which is known as the CIA 
Triad of information assets.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-43">Regardless of the size of an organization, security 
management is an essential task for IT professionals to ensure that 
risks are identified beforehand, and consequently, controls or 
restrictions are applied to minimize its impact on the business.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-44">Security management ensures the interrelationships 
among assessing risk, implementing policies and controls in response to 
the risks, promoting awareness of the expectations, monitoring the 
effectiveness of the controls, and using the collected information as a 
reference point for the next risk assessment.</p>
<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>
<p id="cn-m2-46">After completing this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-47">
<li id="cn-m2-47">Confidentiality, integrity, and availability</li>
<li id="cn-m2-48">Apply security governance principles</li>
<li id="cn-m2-49">Compliance and frameworks</li>
<li id="cn-m2-50">Legal and regulatory issues</li>

<li id="cn-m2-52">Develop and implement documents security policy, standards, procedures, and guidelines</li>
<li id="cn-m2-53">Business continuity requirements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cn-m2-54"><b>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability</b></h3>
<h4 id="cn-m2-55"><b><i>Confidentiality</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-56"><b>Confidentiality </b>aims to prevent information being seen by unauthorized people.</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-57">
<li id="cn-m2-57">Ensures that only authorized people are able to access data</li>
<li id="cn-m2-58">Access controls</li>
<li id="cn-m2-59">Encryption</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-60"><b>Examples of attacks:</b></p>
<ul id="cn-m2-61">
<li id="cn-m2-61">Journalists paying for information</li>
<li id="cn-m2-62">Hackers compromising systems to sell personal information and credit card numbers</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cn-m2-63"><b><i>Integrity</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-64"><b>Integrity </b>involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of the information over its entire lifecycle.</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-65">
<li id="cn-m2-65">Prevents the unauthorized modification of data while in transit and ensures that unauthorized modification is detected</li>
<li id="cn-m2-66">Access controls and audit logging</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-67"><b>Examples of attacks:</b></p>
<ul id="cn-m2-68">
<li id="cn-m2-68">Changes to log files</li>
<li id="cn-m2-69">Changes to permissions</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cn-m2-70"><b><i>Availability</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-71">The <b>availability </b>covers the information with respect to ensuring that the information is available whenever it is needed.</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-72">
<li id="cn-m2-72">Ensures that systems and data are available when needed</li>
<li id="cn-m2-73">Protection against threats</li>
<li id="cn-m2-74">Backups</li>
<li id="cn-m2-75">Fault tolerance and redundancies to ensure high availability</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-76"><b>Examples of attacks:</b></p>
<ul id="cn-m2-77">
<li id="cn-m2-77">Software crashes or bugs</li>
<li id="cn-m2-78">Data deletions</li>
<li id="cn-m2-79">Denial of Service attack</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-80">Safeguarding data includes analyzing the risks, threats
 and the controls required to secure information using accepted security
 standards like strong passwords, security awareness, account lockouts, 
data backups, etc. against social engineering, man-in-the-middle 
attacks, and numerous other attack formats.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-81">Other important concepts include:</p>
<p id="cn-m2-82">Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Auditing, Accountability, Nonrepudiation.</p>
<h3 id="cn-m2-83"><b>Apply Security Governance Principles</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-84">Most importantly is the need to design a system which 
aligns with the business strategy, goals, mission and the business 
objectives. This requires a strong and well-written security policy 
which is adhered to.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-85">Often, a <b>top-down </b>approach is used to design the
 security needs where the key management is responsible for initiating 
and designing the policy structure implemented by different working 
groups within the business. For example, the software development team 
with the design of a custom application and consequently reviewed by a 
security professional who will write the documentation and endorse 
remediation to patch loopholes within the application.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-86">Often this will follow 3 types of a plan known as:</p>
<ol id="cn-m2-87">
<li id="cn-m2-87"><b>Strategic Plan</b>: Long-term which is stable in context and covers goals, missions and organization objectives usually valid for about 5 years.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-88"><b>Tactical Plan</b>: Midterm which has clearer 
details regarding scheduling of activities, the hiring of staff, 
budgets, maintenance, and support. This is valid for about a year in 
length.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-89"><b>Operational Plan</b>: Short-term plan which is 
highly detailed and documents granular processes which include detailed 
budgets, staffing assignments, scheduling, and implementation 
procedures.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cn-m2-90"><b><i>Change management</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-91">Without a good change control process, gaps can appear 
in security measures such as loopholes, overlaps missing objects and 
oversights. A planning process should include documented and audited <b>planning</b>, <b>testing</b>, <b>logging</b>, <b>auditing </b>and <b>monitoring </b>of activities related to security controls.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-92">The idea is that any changes which happened can indeed 
be rolled back should it become apparent that the change had a negative 
effect on the business and/or security.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-93"><b><i>Data classification </i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-94">Data is typically considered against its secrecy, 
sensitivity or confidentiality. The process involves organizing objects,
 items, and subjects into groups or categories which have defined 
security roles and rules to prohibit and control how information is 
being accessed and by whom. Often the different standards will involve 
the usefulness, value (cost), maturity, national security, restriction, 
and storage to name a few of the used concepts.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-95">After which information will be given classifications 
of differing levels such as Confidential, Private, Sensitive and Public 
or Top Secret, Secret, Confidential and Unclassified. It’s also 
important to list out the relevant security roles and the 
responsibilities of those who will be assuming said roles. These need to
 be quite prescriptive in nature. Common roles include Senior Manager, 
Security Professional, Data Owner, Data Custodian, User, and Auditor.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-96">The exercise of due care describes what legal duty is considered to be whereas a lack of due care is termed as negligence.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-97">The application of due diligence is a pre-emptive measure taken to avoid harm to other persons or their property.</p>
<h3 id="cn-m2-98"><b>Compliance and Frameworks</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-99">Compliance refers to actions that ensure the organization complies with rules, laws as well the organization's policies.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-100"><b><i>Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-101">Governance, risk management, and compliance manage 
risks in line with business and compliance objectives. Governance 
ensures that the business focuses on the core goals and objectives and 
defines who in the organization has the authority to make decisions, who
 is accountable, and responsible for the outcomes. It also addresses how
 expected performance will be evaluated.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-102"><b><i>Legislative and regulatory compliance </i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-103">Organizations must operate under the laws, 
regulations, and compliance requirements within the country and the 
industry, and security professionals must understand these.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-104"><b><i>Privacy requirements compliance </i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-105">Personally, identifiable information is becoming an 
extremely valuable commodity for both legal and illegal entities where 
data protection is essential to private information. There is a huge 
growth in social networking sites which allows individuals to expose 
huge quantities of personal information, while this is useful, it is 
also valuable information, such as their personal locations which can be
 live updates, where they are traveling and what new personal items they
 may have acquired through purchases.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-106">IS027001 is a key piece of the framework used and 
recognized around the world as a basis for security practices. It’s the 
international standard that describes best practice for an information 
security management system (ISMS).</p>
<p id="cn-m2-107">It is designed to serve as a single reference point 
for identifying the range of controls needed for most situations where 
information systems are used.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-108"><b><i>ISMS Family of Standards</i></b></h4>
<ul id="cn-m2-109">
<li id="cn-m2-109">ISO/IEC 27001:2013</li>
<li id="cn-m2-110">ISO/IEC 27002:2013</li>
<li id="cn-m2-111">ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011</li>
<li id="cn-m2-112">ISO/IEC 27013:2012</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-113">If security around credit card payment systems is required, then most commonly companies seek out:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-114">
<li id="cn-m2-114"><b>PCI DSS </b>- Standard to be followed for credit card payment systems.</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-115">To ensure that the security and privacy requirements 
are met, most businesses adopt control frameworks to provide governance 
that is:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-116">
<li id="cn-m2-116"><b>Consistent </b>- In approach and how it is applied.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-117"><b>Measurable </b>- Provide a way to determine progress and set goals.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-118"><b>Standardized </b>- Results should be comparable in a meaningful way.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-119"><b>Comprehensive </b>- Cover the minimum legal and regulatory requirements and be extensible to accommodate additional specific requirements.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-120"><b>Modular </b>- The ability to overcome changes and assist in organizing data for compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-121">Examples include:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-122">
<li id="cn-m2-122"><b>NIST </b>- American bound guidelines which are very thorough</li>
<li id="cn-m2-123"><b>COBIT </b>- A methodology assisting with security audits and risk management</li>
<li id="cn-m2-124"><b>ITIL </b>- A methodology assisting with audits and processes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cn-m2-125"><b>Legal and Regulatory Issues </b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-126">The first difference where the law is concerned is the idea of what criminal law is and what common law refers to.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-127"><b><span class="cn-underlined">Criminal </span><span class="cn-underlined">Law </span></b>-
 Body of laws which aim at preserving peace and safety in society. The 
punishment for breaking these laws are often fines, imprisonment and 
community service.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-128"><b><span class="cn-underlined">Common </span><span class="cn-underlined">Law </span><span class="cn-underlined">/ </span><span class="cn-underlined">Civil </span><span class="cn-underlined">Law </span></b>-
 Laws which refer to matters other than crimes such as contract 
disputes, employment or estate matters. These can also result in 
criminal law punishments.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-129"><b><span class="cn-underlined">Administrative </span><span class="cn-underlined">Law</span><span class="cn-underlined">/ </span><span class="cn-underlined">Public </span><span class="cn-underlined">Law </span></b>- These refer to activities around crafting of rules or enforcement of regulations, duties, and rights of public bodies.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-130">The laws themselves differ in terms of interpretation,
 implementation and exact wording between countries. To address these 
differences, nations have international agreements like extradition 
treaties to prosecute criminals and lawbreakers. However, on the whole, 
there are a number of laws between countries that have the same aim.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-131"><b><span class="cn-underlined">Computer </span><span class="cn-underlined">Fraud </span><span class="cn-underlined">and </span><span class="cn-underlined">Abuse </span><span class="cn-underlined">Act </span><span class="cn-underlined">(</span><span class="cn-underlined">Explained</span><span class="cn-underlined">) </span></b>- A crime is committed when:</p>
<p id="cn-m2-132">Access to classified and financial information without permission, even more so if the device belongs to the government.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-133">Using a device to commit fraud or cause malicious damage to a computer system, application or another.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-134">Modifying medical information on the computer which 
results in the loss or impairment of examination, diagnosis, treatment 
or care of an individual.</p>

<p id="cn-m2-136">The following is just an extract of laws which need to be understood.</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-137">
<li id="cn-m2-137">Comprehensive Crime Control Act CCCA 1984</li>
<li id="cn-m2-138">1994 CFAA Amendments</li>
<li id="cn-m2-139">Computer Security Act of 1987</li>

<li id="cn-m2-141">Government Information Security Reform Act of 2000</li>
<li id="cn-m2-142">Federal Information Security Management Act</li>
<li id="cn-m2-143">Copyrights and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act</li>
<li id="cn-m2-144">Economic Espionage Act of 1996</li>
<li id="cn-m2-145">Privacy Act of 1974</li>
<li id="cn-m2-146">Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986</li>
<li id="cn-m2-147">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-148"><b><span class="cn-underlined">Additional </span><span class="cn-underlined">UK </span><span class="cn-underlined">Laws</span></b></p>
<ul id="cn-m2-149">
<li id="cn-m2-149">The Computer Misuse Act 1990</li>
<li id="cn-m2-150">The Data Protection Act 1998</li>
<li id="cn-m2-151">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</li>
<li id="cn-m2-152">Communication Data Bill</li>
<li id="cn-m2-153">Fraud Act 2006</li>
<li id="cn-m2-154">Forgery and Counterfeiting act 1981</li>
<li id="cn-m2-155">Copyright, Design, and Patents Act 1998</li>
<li id="cn-m2-156">Obscene Publication Act 1959</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-157">The key problem is that as computer networks across 
different jurisdictions, such as the Internet, it becomes increasingly 
harder to stay within the law of different countries. Companies can 
quite easily find themselves being subjected to disputes without 
realizing they have broken any law at all.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-158">Therefore, when it comes to compliance on an 
international scale, following security Standards such as the Payment 
Card Industry Data Security Standard or PCI DSS is a good idea. These 
are not laws but are standards used to comply with regulations by 
observing what is considered good security practice and that which meets
 the regulations of that country. By meeting the PCI-DSS in a 
contractual agreement, the business can demonstrate that they are 
enforcing controls against financial fraud for example.</p>
<h3 id="cn-m2-159"><b>Professional Ethics</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-160">Often most business now employ regulatory requirements for ethics programs and training.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-161">Generally, these a code of ethics applies to all professionals within IT.</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-162">
<li id="cn-m2-162">Computers in the workplace</li>
<li id="cn-m2-163">Computer Crime</li>
<li id="cn-m2-164">Privacy and Anonymity</li>
<li id="cn-m2-165">Intellectual Property</li>

<li id="cn-m2-167">Compliance with the preamble and canons is mandatory to maintain membership and credentials</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-168">Compliance with the preamble and canons is mandatory to maintain membership and credentials.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-169"><b><i>Code of Ethics </i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-170">In simplest terms, a code of ethics is a set of principles that serves two key purposes:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-171">
<li id="cn-m2-171">Each individual must conduct business honestly</li>
<li id="cn-m2-172">Each individual must conduct business with integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-173">Most organizations have a code of ethics document, which contains the mission and values of the organization.</p>
<h3 id="cn-m2-174"><b>Develop and implement documented Security Policy, Standards, Procedures, and Guidelines</b></h3>
<h4 id="cn-m2-175"><b><i>Security Policies </i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-176">This document is used to define the scope of security 
required by the business; it includes which assets are to be considered 
and how far a security solution should be implemented, it holds the 
security objectives and framework outline. This forms the strategic plan
 and also begins the assignment of roles, audit requirements, acceptable
 risk levels, and responsibilities.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-177">In general, there are three forms of policy which are used namely:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-178">
<li id="cn-m2-178"><b>Regulatory </b>-This ensures that the organization is following standards set by specific industry regulations (HIPAA, GLBA, PCI-DSS).</li>
<li id="cn-m2-179"><b>Advisory </b>-This advises employees as to which types of behaviors and activities should and should not take place within the organization.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-180"><b>Informative </b>- This is not an enforceable policy, rather it teaches individuals about specific issues relevant to the company.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cn-m2-181"><b><i>Security Standards, Baselines, Guidelines, and Procedures</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-182">Standards are mandatory activities, actions, or rules.
 They give a policy some support and reinforcement in direction. 
Organizational security standards may specify how hardware and software 
products should be used and expected user behavior. This acts to ensure 
that specific technologies, applications, parameters, and procedures are
 implemented in a uniform (standardized) manner across the organization.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-183"><b>Baselining </b>refers to forming a comparison point
 for future changes resulting in a consistent reference point. Once 
risks have been mitigated and security put in place, a baseline is 
formally reviewed and agreed upon, after which all further comparisons 
and development are measured against it.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-184"><b>Guidelines </b>are recommended actions and 
operational instructions for users, IT and operations staff or others 
when a specific standard does not apply. Guidelines map out the 
methodologies of technology, personnel, or physical security.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-185"><b>Procedures </b>are used to present detailed 
step-by-step actions for the same staff members. For example, install 
operating systems, configuring security devices, implementing access

<h3 id="cn-m2-187"><b>Business Continuity Requirements</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-188">There are four key steps to observe:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-189">
<li id="cn-m2-189">Project scope and planning</li>
<li id="cn-m2-190">Business impact assessment</li>
<li id="cn-m2-191">Continuity planning</li>
<li id="cn-m2-192">Approval and implementation</li>

<p id="cn-m2-194">An analysis is performed of the resources, legal and 
regulatory requirements around the business by a newly formed business 
continuity planning (BCP) team that has senior management approval.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-195">The BCP team consists of representatives from 
different departments such as security, finance, IT and legal 
departments. The team then works to establish the plan Development 
Testing, Training and Maintenance, and Implementation.</p>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m2-196"><b>Supporting Lab Material - Security and Risk Management Part 2</b></h2>
<p id="cn-m2-197">Continuing the exploration of security and risk management the following objectives will now be considered:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-198">
<li id="cn-m2-198">Contribute to personnel security policies</li>
<li id="cn-m2-199">Apply risk management concepts</li>
<li id="cn-m2-200">Apply threat modeling</li>
<li id="cn-m2-201">Integrate security risk considerations and into acquisition strategy and practice</li>
<li id="cn-m2-202">Establish and management information security education, training, and awareness</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cn-m2-203"><b>Contribute to Personnel Security Policies</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-204">Security policies related to personnel need to contain
 clear guidelines on working with not only a variety of situations in 
recruitment but also working on maintaining security checks on current 
employees and should to deal with contractors who enter the business as 
3rd party workers.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-205"><b><i>Employment candidate screening</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-206">Checks are first typically performed against the job role and organization security to ensure that qualified and suitable.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-207">Standard checks used:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-208">
<li id="cn-m2-208">Reference checks</li>
<li id="cn-m2-209">Background checks</li>
<li id="cn-m2-210">Criminal record checks</li>
<li id="cn-m2-211">Counter-terrorist checks</li>
<li id="cn-m2-212">Prior employment</li>
<li id="cn-m2-213">Credit history</li>
</ul>
<p id="cn-m2-214">Other essential checks for suitability:</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-215">
<li id="cn-m2-215">Driving records</li>
<li id="cn-m2-216">Drug tests</li>
<li id="cn-m2-217">ID checks</li>
<li id="cn-m2-218">Education</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cn-m2-219"><b><i>Employment agreements and policies</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-220">Job rotation is used to reduce the risk of collusion 
between individuals, whereas least privilege allows users only access to
 functions required to perform their job role. Often the application of 
mandatory vacations/holidays on specified consecutive-day periods help 
to break up job boredom and monotony. Finally, separation of duties 
prevents one individual from performing all activities single-handedly, 
for example, involving senior management’s input for creating the job 
description helps draw the line where an employee responsibility begins 
and ends.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-221"><b><i>Employment termination processes</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-222">Regular termination is a standard procedure where an 
amicable agreement between two parties (employer and employee) has been 
reached, and company property is returned with an exit interview.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-223">Unfriendly terminations result from an individual 
being fired, involuntarily transferred or laid off maybe for gross 
misconduct or breach of contract.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-224"><b><i>The vendor, consultant, and contractor controls</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-225">Business partners or third parties often subcontract 
and need personnel to visit locations, as such a screening committee 
helps to prevent the risk of information loss. Third parties who are on 
site or accessing systems should be escorted with specific monitoring in
 mind. If the site is high security implemented, then an Enhanced 
non-disclosure document should be signed.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-226">Regular or permanent third parties onsite will have to
 undergo comparative screening as well as specific monitoring and 
signing an enhanced non-disclosure document.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-227"><b><i>Compliance</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-228">To ensure the organization complies with established 
rules as well as providing the tools to verify that compliance, and 
includes adherence with laws as well the organization’s policies.</p>
<h4 id="cn-m2-229"><b><i>Privacy</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-230">Typically, most individuals expect a level of privacy 
both at work and in private life. Therefore, a security professional 
must respect how information is monitored especially when different 
jurisdictions are concerned.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-231">As an example, most people agree to CCTV cameras 
placed on front door entrances but not within personal environments such
 as a toilet or shower.</p>
<h3 id="cn-m2-232"><b>Apply Risk Management Concepts</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-233"><b><span class="cn-underlined">Definition</span><span class="cn-underlined">:</span></b></p>
<p id="cn-m2-234">“<b>Risk </b>is a function of the likelihood of a 
given threat source’s exercising a particular potential vulnerability 
and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organization”-NIST
 SP 800-30.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-235"><b>Risk management </b>- systematic application of 
management policies, procedures and practices to the activities of 
communicating, consulting, establishing the context and identifying, 
analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring and reviewing risk.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-236">Threats exploit vulnerabilities creating risk.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-237">Risk management is the process of identifying, 
assessing, and prioritizing threats and risks.&nbsp;Risk assessments are
 used to identify the risks that might impact your particular 
environment.</p>
<ul id="cn-m2-238">
<li id="cn-m2-238">Risk is generally defined as the probability that an event will occur.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-239">A threat, which is defined as an action or occurrence
 that could result in the breach, outage, or corruption of a system by 
exploiting known or unknown vulnerabilities.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-240">The goal of any risk management plan is to remove 
risks when possible and to minimize the consequences of risks that 
cannot be eliminated.</li>

<p id="cn-m2-254">In the table below the following key should be observed:</p>
<p id="cn-m2-255">L - Low Risk</p>
<p id="cn-m2-256">M - Medium Risk</p>
<p id="cn-m2-257">H - High Risk</p>

<p id="cn-m2-260">By applying a matrix, the risk levels become 
associated with cells which assist when making decisions based on 
control expenditure and explaining the severity of events to senior

</ul>
<h4 id="cn-m2-280"><b><i>Risk Mitigation and Controls</i></b></h4>
<p id="cn-m2-281">Risk has four essential control groups, namely:</p>
<ol id="cn-m2-282">
<li id="cn-m2-282"><b>Risk reduction </b>- Controls are used to reduce the likelihood/impact of the risk or minimise loss.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-283"><b>Risk avoidance </b>- Removing the threat by using alternate behavior to end the exposure.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-284"><b>Risk transfer </b>- Pass risk onto 3rd party such as an insurance company.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-285"><b>Risk retention/acceptance </b>- accepting the risk
 outcome as necessary to continuing the business goals and confirming 
monetary funds are available if required.</li>
</ol>
<p id="cn-m2-286">The controls are classified as Directive, deterrent, 
preventive, compensating, detective, corrective, recovery. Example of 
which include:</p>
<ol id="cn-m2-287">
<li id="cn-m2-287"><b>Technical controls </b>- Authentication, access control, encryption, etc.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-288"><b>Procedural controls </b>- Security awareness, training, etc.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-289"><b>Physical controls </b>- Fences, doors, fire suppression, etc.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-290"><b>Legal, regulatory and compliance </b>- Security policies, regulations, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cn-m2-291"><b>Apply Threat Modeling</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-292">Threat modeling aims first to understand how the 
business assets could be attractive to nefarious activities from either 
external or internal actors. Then work to reduce the threat surface of 
the business model by implementing proactive and reactive 
countermeasures.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-293">A common term used is to Secure by Design, Secure by Default, Secure in Deployment and Communication.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-294">Threats are reviewed considering their probability of 
occurrence, impact levels, the priority of concerns or threat reduction 
methods. This considers the assets, attackers and software, the hardware
 of the business.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-295">The analysis will then form a “defense in depth” which means using multiple layers of security to defend your assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="cn-m2-296">That way, even if an attacker breaches one layer of 
your defense, you have additional layers to keep that person out of the 
critical areas of your environment where the outer defenses protect 
internally held assets. If outer defenses are breached - inner defenses 
must be strong enough to protect the assets.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-297">These protection mechanisms, therefore, provide layering, abstraction, data hiding, and encryption.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-298">Typical threats to be considerate of immediately are 
Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of 
Service and Elevation of Privileges.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-299">These form the acronym of <b>STRIDE</b>. This provides
 the first stage in reviewing the assets against threats by considering 
how easily an asset is manipulated by STRIDE actors. Flow diagrams help 
to demonstrate the processes and defenses which are in place visually.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-300">Once clarified, the next logical step is to perform 
reduction analysis or to decompose the application, system or 
environment in an effort to gain a great understanding of the 
interactions with all the elements involved when the threat exercises 
actions.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-301">Here the auditing checking for Trust Boundaries, Data 
Flow Paths, Input Paths, Privileged Operations, and Security Stand and 
Approach. Once conclusions are drawn, it’s time to list the priorities 
and Responses using <b>DREAD </b>or Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users and Discoverability.</p>
<h3 id="cn-m2-302"><b>Integrate security risk considerations into acquisition strategy and practice</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-303">The purchasing of equipment, software, and staff is 
essential to risk management strategies, as an incorrect asset could 
alter the risk evaluation significantly. However, resilient integrated 
security options are more expensive than assets which provide very 
straightforward solutions.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-304">It’s important to consider the lifetime of the asset, 
the total cost of ownership including maintenance fees, the elements of 
the contractual agreement and how they will be enforced. Software needs 
constant monitoring to make sure it's behaving correctly and to the 
designed specifications.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-305">If using contractors, then the security clearance of that personnel need to be understood.</p>
<ol id="cn-m2-306">
<li id="cn-m2-306"><b>On-Site Assessment </b>- where staff is interviewed and observed.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-307"><b>Document Exchange and Review </b>- How datasets and documentation are exchanged securely.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-308"><b>Process/Policy Review </b>- Copies of security policies should be readily available for review.</li>
<li id="cn-m2-309">Where a process is non-existent, then this should be 
modeled from the business security policy to establish a minimum level 
of acceptance.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cn-m2-310"><b>Establish and manage information security education, training, and awareness</b></h3>
<p id="cn-m2-311">A security professional should assist with formal 
security awareness training as a method to inform employees about their 
roles, and expectations surrounding their roles, with regards to 
information security. This helps to inform about a particular security 
or risk management function while achieving regulatory and legislative 
compliance.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-312">Further, there should be training lessons based on the
 different business functions and the risks. For example, a lesson 
related to the finance department from monetary fraud attempts, the 
Human Resources department regarding personal information and phishing 
attempts and higher management regarding spear phishing attacks.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-313"><b>Awareness </b>aims at bringing security to the 
forefront by raising its importance to all staff members not just the IT
 security team. Security awareness training can be achieved through 
screensavers, posters, announcements, as well as courses.</p>
<p id="cn-m2-314"><b>Training </b>helps employees understand how to comply with security while performing their job role.</p>
